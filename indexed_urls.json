    "content": "Ensuring the security of your connection Ensuring the security of your connection Loading... Why am I seeing this? You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up BotStopper to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites . This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone. BotStopper is a compromise. BotStopper uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash , a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive. Ultimately, this is a hack whose real purpose is to give a \"good enough\" placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate. Please note that BotStopper requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain. This website is running Anubis version v1.19.2 . Sadly, you must enable JavaScript to get past this challenge. This is required because AI companies have changed the social contract around how website hosting works. A no-JS solution is a work-in-progress. Protected by BotStopper from Techaro .

The year of AI Kicking off with what will undoubtedly be one of the biggest trends for the year ahead: AI. \u00a0For 2025, we can expect firms to increasingly implement AI tools. \u00a0The Journal of Accountancy writes that AI can be used to perform journal entry testing or in the planning phase to perform risk identification.

It is a remarkable step in ensuring the financial security of workers across the whole country. For the first time, the government of Nepal introduced the contribution-based Social Security Act, 2018 (2075), to strengthen workers\u2019 economic and social protection during and after their employment. The Social Security Fund provides financial support to employees and their families in times of need, such as illness, accidents, retirement, and covers all medical expenses. In addition, the official enrolment Gazette Notice does not limit SSF registration to any specific industry or sector, which means all the registered companies and organisations, regardless of their nature of business, must enrol with the SSF. What Is Social Security Fund (SSF) In Nepal? Nepal\u2019s Social Security Fund (SSF) is a contributory system where workers and employers contribute money to help protect employees financially, including those working in formal, informal, and even self-employed sectors. The concept of SSF was introduced in Nepal for the first time in 2011 and was expanded by the Social Security Act of 2018 to include more groups, like migrant workers and freelancers.
